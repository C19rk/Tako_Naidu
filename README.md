## Backstory
This website project was given to us in our Software Development 1 (CPE302) course. The task was to develop a website for a small business. I developed all of the website's frontend while my teammates contributed by helping locate the business, contacting the business owner, assisting with the presentation, and giving me ideas. I handled the entire frontend development, implementing all core functionality, as my teammates did not have the coding experience required. After completing the website, I pushed the project to GitHub.

### Note
The GitHub URL of this project is missing somehow. Since the files were deleted, and I just reuploaded them this year.
